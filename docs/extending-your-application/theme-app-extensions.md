# Theme App Extensions

[Shopify's Theme App Extension docs](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions/getting-started)

I have created the following addons to manage extensions:

- [osb-addon-extension-manager](https://github.com/Michael-Gibbons/osb-addon-extension-manager)

?> osb-addon-extension-manager provides the cli code for managing all shopify extensions.

- [osb-addon-theme-extension-base](https://github.com/Michael-Gibbons/osb-addon-theme-extension-base)

?> osb-addon-theme-extension-base provides the base code for an app theme extension using React + Vite.
